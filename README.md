# Subnet Calculator

Program takes an IPv4 address and subnet mask as an input and returns following information:

- IPv4 address
- Subnet mask in dotted decimal format and CIDR notation
- Network address
- Broadcast address
- First IP address in the subnet
- Last IP address in the subnet
- Usable hosts per subnet
- Wildcard mask

## Usage

You need Python version 3.6 or later to run the program.
You can download Python from official website: [https://www.python.org/getit/](https://www.python.org/getit/)

When the program is run, user is prompted to input IP address and subnet mask:

```plain
Enter an IP address:
```

Program will accept IPv4 address from class A, B, C except:

- 127.0.0.0/ 8 - used for loopback addresses
- 169.254.0.0/16 - used for link-local addresses

```plain
Enter a subnet mask:
```

Subnet mask should be entered in dotted decimal format e.g. 255.255.255.0. Program will accept subnet mask from 255.0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.
If you use subnet mask 255.255.255.254 (/31) or 255.255.255.255 (/32) program returns None for: network and broadcast address, first and last IP address, usable hosts per subnet.

## Example

```plain
Enter an IP address: 1.1.1.1
Enter a subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
--------------------------------------------------
CIDR notation:       /24 (255.255.255.0)
First usable IP:     1.1.1.1
Last usable IP:      1.1.1.254
Broadcast:           1.1.1.255
Usable hosts:        254
Network:             1.1.1.0
Wildcard mask:       0.0.0.255
```
